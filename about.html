    <p>I’m a writer and poet from Boston, currently serving in the U.S. Army National Guard. I grew up wrestling, boxing, and building things with my hands—and somewhere in the chaos, I found language.</p>
    <p>My writing has earned a Scholastic Silver Key in poetry, along with multiple honorable mentions. I’ve been published in literary magazines and I’m currently working on several projects, including a novel, a manga, and one day a cross-country charity run.</p>
    <p>I write like it matters. Because it does.</p>
