<p>I’m a writer and poet from Boston, currently serving in the U.S. Army National Guard. I grew up wrestling,
boxing, and building things with my hands—and somewhere in the chaos, I found language.</p>
<p>My writing has earned a Scholastic Silver Key in poetry, along with multiple honorable mentions. I’ve been
published in literary magazines and I’m currently working on several projects, including a novel, a manga,
and one day a cross-country charity run.</p>
<p>I write like it matters. Because it does.</p>
